### About myself
Although I had been interested in programming since high school, I decided to study humanities. I continued programming as a hobby and became involved in the Linux community. I have long made it a habit to use open source tools, including in my academic and scientific pursuits.

I have experience with the Neovim and Emacs editors, have used LaTex, and have been exposed to various programming languages including Python, Elisp, Dart (Flutter), and Kotlin.

After broadening my horizons and learning a few foreign languages, I decided to turn my hobby into a career. 

### Skills:
- HTML5
- CSS3 (SASS/SCSS, BEM)
- JavaScript/Typesript

### Code Example
``` js
function isValidIP(str) {
  const arr = str.split('.');
  const regex = /^0\d|[\D]|\s/;
  
  if (arr.length !== 4 || arr.some((n) => n.length === 0 || regex.test(n))) {
    return false;
  }
  
  return arr.every((n) => Number(n) <= 255);
}
```
